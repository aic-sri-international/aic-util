#summary The Experiment library.

A common need in computer science research is to run experiments, collect results and plot them for publication.
This [https://code.google.com/p/aic-util/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/com/sri/ai/util/experiment library] addresses this need by using the [RangeOperations range operations] declarative mini-language and the [Gnuplot Gnuplot] library.
<p>
Here is a typical use of the library:
{{{
experiment(
	"file", "false",
	"title", "The more samples, the less variance",
	"xlabel", "Number of samples",
	"ylabel", "Average of Uniform[0,1] + mean - 0.5",
	"some unused variable that could be used if we wanted to", 10,
	
	new Dimension("mean", Util.list(2, 3)),
	new Dimension("numSamples", 1, 200, 1),
	
	averageOfNumSamplesOfUniformPlusCurrentMeanMinusZeroPointFive,
				
	new DataSeriesSpec("mean", Util.list(
			Util.list("title 'mean 2'", "w linespoints"),
			Util.list("title 'mean 3'", "w linespoints"))));
}}}
