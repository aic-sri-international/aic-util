=Introduction=
A general purpose Java library, developed at [http://www.ai.sri.com/ SRI International's Artificial Intelligence Center] and built on top of Google's [http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/ guava-libraries], which adds capabilities in the following areas:

  * General purpose [GeneralUtilityRoutines utility routines] for String manipulation, [Collections Collections], Error, and [Math Math].
  * [ExtendedIteratorSemantics Extended Iterator semantics] ([http://code.google.com/p/aic-util/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/com/sri/ai/util/functionalsequence/FunctionalSequence.java functional sequences] and [http://code.google.com/p/aic-util/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/com/sri/ai/util/functionalsequence/Refiner.java refiners]).
  * [Concurrency Concurrency service] for simplifying the [http://code.google.com/p/aic-util/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/com/sri/ai/util/concurrent/BranchAndMerge.java branching and merging] of computation tasks.
  * Simplified [Configuration Configuration API].
  * Support for [Logging logging] of high-level execution traces.
  * Extensions to [FunctionalIdiomExtensions Guava's functional idioms].
