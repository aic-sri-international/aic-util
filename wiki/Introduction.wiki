A general purpose Java library, developed at [http://www.ai.sri.com/ SRI International's Artificial Intelligence Center] and built on top of Google's [http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/ guava-libraries], which adds capabilities in the following areas:

  * General purpose utility routines for String manipulation, Collections, Error, and Math.
  * Extended Iterator semantics (functional sequences and refiners).
  * Concurrency service for simplifying the branching and merging of computation tasks.
  * Simplified Configuration API.
  * Support for logging of high-level execution traces.
  * Extensions to [http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/FunctionalExplained Guava's functional idioms].
