#summary General Utility Routines

A suite of static general purpose utility routines can be found in the [http://code.google.com/p/aic-util/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/com/sri/ai/util/Util.java Util class]. These have been included in a single file in order to simplify usage, so that it is only necessary to enter:
{{{
Util.|
}}} 
in your IDE and then select the appropriate utility routine. The routines available can be grouped as follows:

  * Error Handling:
{{{
    void fatalError(...)
    void fatalErrorWithoutStack(...)
}}}
  * I/O:
{{{
    String readAll(InputStream ...)
}}}
  * String Manipulation (Note: these overlap with Guava's String routines and will likely delegate or be removed in the future):
{{{
    String join(...)
}}}
