# Overview
A general purpose Java library, developed at [SRI International's Artificial Intelligence Center](http://www.ai.sri.com/) 
and built on top of Google's guava-libraries, which adds capabilities in the following areas:

* General purpose utility routines for String manipulation, Collections, Error, and Math.
* Extended Iterator semantics (functional sequences and refiners).
* Concurrency service for simplifying the branching and merging of computation tasks.
* Simplified Configuration API.
* Support for logging of high-level execution traces.
* Extensions to Guava's functional idioms.
* Programmatic interface to gnuplot.
* Declarative mini-language for specifying experiments, with file and gnuplot generation.
