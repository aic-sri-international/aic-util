/**
 * An interface for a tree-based computation.
 * A tree-based computation consists of a function applied to the results
 * of a list of sub-computations (which are typically tree-based computations themselves).
 * <p>
 * Implementations must provide a method that provides the sub-computations,
 * and the function to be applied to them.
 * The result of the tree computation is the result returned by the function.
