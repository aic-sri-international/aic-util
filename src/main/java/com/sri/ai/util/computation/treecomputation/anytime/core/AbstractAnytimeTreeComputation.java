/**
 * An abstract implementation of {@link AnytimeTreeComputation}
 * that borrows most functionality based on a given base {@link TreeComputation}
 * and an {@link ApproximationScheme}.
 * <p>
 * Essentially, this creates an anytime tree computation by
 * lazily expanding, node by node, the base tree computation, and creating
 * anytime versions of them that are used to compute the next approximation
 * to the final root value.
 * <p>
 * Initially, the value of the anytime root computation is
 * the approximation provided by the approximation scheme's
 * <code>totalIgnorance</code> method.
 * <p>
 * Then, in order to create the next approximation,
 * this class creates sub-anytime approximations
 * by requesting the base tree computation's children
 * and computing their anytime versions with
 * {@link #makeAnytimeVersion(NullaryFunction)}
 * (which must be implemented by extending classes).
 * The sub-anytime tree computations's approximations
 * are then used by the approximation scheme to compute the new
 * approximation to the root, by also using the base tree computation's function.
 * <p>
 * To update an even better next approximation,
 * the class picks the next anytime sub-computation
 * by using the abstract method {@link #pickNextSubWithNext()},
 * which is also to be specified by extensions.
 * <p>
 * It then iterates the picked next anytime sub-computation,
 * obtaining a new approximation to the corresponding argument,
 * and delegates the computation of the new approximation
 * of the root anytime tree computation to the approximation scheme.
