/**
 * A skeleton of interfaces and default implementation for a machine learning, and specifically a decision tree, library.
 * 
 * As of January 2016, does not contain example implementations of {@link com.sri.ai.util.ml.api.DataSet} and {@link com.sri.ai.util.ml.decisiontree.api.SplitAnalyzer}.
 * A good first cut would be vectors of discrete variables with a split analyzer based on information gain.
